# npm run setup — one-command contributor bootstrap for the local quality
# gate. Wires .pre-commit-config.yaml into this clone's Git hooks.
#
# Resolving the pinned version (`prek --version` below) always goes
# through `pipx run --spec prek==X.Y.Z` (or the uv equivalent), never a
# `prek` already on PATH -- that removes the "wrong version" class of bug
# regardless of what else is installed or where it sits on PATH.
#
# Actually WIRING the hooks is different: `prek install` embeds the
# absolute path it was invoked from into the generated hook script, so
# pointing it at an ephemeral `pipx run`/`uv tool run` cache entry bakes a
# path into .git/hooks/pre-commit that can silently stop existing later
# (pipx documents its run-cache as pruned after as little as 14 days;
# reported against this script). Once pruned, every commit fails with a
# missing-executable error until `npm run setup` is re-run. So the pinned
# version is installed *persistently* (`pipx install --force` / `uv tool
# install --force`, not `run`) before `prek install` runs, so the
# embedded path survives.
#
# gitleaks has no such wrapper (a Go binary, not a Python package) and is
# still expected to be a real installed binary on PATH.
#
# That persistent install happens UNCONDITIONALLY, before the
# core.hooksPath check below, even though hook wiring itself is skipped
# on a hooks_path clone: scripts/check.sh resolves prek from this
# persistent path or from PATH, never from the ephemeral function above,
# so a hooks_path machine with uv/pipx but no already-global `prek` still
# needs the persistent binary for `npm run check` to work.
#
# core.hooksPath handling: ANY custom hooks path means this clone's own
# .git/hooks won't run (a maintainer-machine convention routes ALL repos
# through one global dispatcher instead) -- only the hook-WIRING step
# (`prek install`) is skipped in that case, without trying to identify
# which dispatcher it is; the persistent install and the prek/gitleaks
# checks above all still run.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run any time (e.g. after .github/workflows/ci.yml
# bumps the pinned prek version) -- `--force` re-pins the persistent
# install to whatever version is current.
