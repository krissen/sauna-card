# npm run setup — one-command contributor bootstrap for the local quality
# gate. Wires .pre-commit-config.yaml into this clone's Git hooks by
# running prek through `pipx run --spec prek==X.Y.Z` (or the uv
# equivalent) instead of relying on a `prek` already on PATH.
#
# `pipx run --spec`/`uv tool run --from` always resolve the exact pinned
# spec from their own cache, regardless of what else is installed or
# where it sits on PATH. `prek install` embeds the absolute path it was
# invoked from into the generated hook script, so the Git hook itself
# execs that cached, version-pinned binary directly on every commit -- no
# pipx/uv overhead per commit, only during this setup step.
#
# gitleaks has no such wrapper (a Go binary, not a Python package) and is
# still expected to be a real installed binary on PATH.
#
# core.hooksPath handling: ANY custom hooks path means this clone's own
# .git/hooks won't run (a maintainer-machine convention routes ALL repos
# through one global dispatcher instead) -- hook installation is skipped
# in that case, without trying to identify which dispatcher it is. The
# prek/gitleaks checks above still run either way, since `npm run check`
# needs them regardless of how hooks are wired.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run any time (e.g. after .github/workflows/ci.yml
# bumps the pinned prek version).
